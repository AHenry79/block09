            <h2>Teaching English in Japan</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a child, I loved music. And thanks to guitar hero, I fell in love with the guitar.
                I startetd playing when I was about 9 years old. At the time, I loved pop punk bands like Green Day and The Offspring.
                However, as I continued to play guitar and listen to more music, I discovered a passion for metal music.
                And that all led to today, where I'm a huge fan of death metal music and I often make covers of my favorite
                songs and post them onto my instagram for fun. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also played tenor saxophone for band in both middle and high school. And while I always appreciated classical and 
                jazz music, it was never my passion.

            <p>
                I've always loved the outdoors ever since I was little. Often times, my sister and I would spend the majority of our
                time outdoors, playing in the dirt and wooded areas behind our house. I've held a great appreciation of nature
                but I never really hiked until I moved to Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I moved to Japan, I was placed in Mie prefecture. Mie prefecture is home to many beautiful mountains and hiking 
                trails. It was there that I made many friends who enjoyed hiking and invited me to hike with them. I accpeted and it 
                changed me forever. Now, I love hiking, and will come up with any excuse to get out and go hiking whenever I can.

            <h2>Sales</h2>
            <p>
                I started golfing very young, but only ever played for fun. However, in high school, I wanted to join a sports team. 
                The golf team seemed to align with what I was looking for the most, so I started taking lessons, and joined the team.
                After taking lessons and playing on the team with my friends, I really began to truly love golf.

            <p>
                Since starting university, I've been playing golf every summer with my friends. I am still by no means any good, but 
                I always have a good time playing.
