            <h2>Teaching English in Japan</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated with a degree in Japanese studies from Adrian College here in Michigan. And while I was a student, I worked 
                as a tutor for Japanese students studying English, and English speaking students studying Japanese. It was here that I 
                discovered my love of teaching. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With my newfound passion, I applied for the JET program to teach English abroad in Japan. I lived and worked in Japan for
                about 2 years as an English teacher, teaching a variety of students. From 1st and second grade, all the way into 9th.

            <h2>Translating</h2>
            <p>
                While I was teaching in Japan, I was also asked to do translations for my schools. I translated posters, emails, among 
                other things so that the schools could communicate with parents and other schools outside of Japan that did not speak 
                Japanese. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also participated in a course for JET program participants with exceptional Japanese. In this program, we were taught 
                how to professionally translate, and what sorts of things to expect working as a translator.

            <h2>Modeling</h2>
            <p>
                When I was a univsersity student, I studied abroad in Japan. I was a student at Kansai Gaidai University in Osaka, Japan.
                While I was there, I was propositioned to do professional modeling for the school. I modeled for photos used in brochures
                for the school. I modeled in videos for new classes the school was offering. And I modeled for promotional posters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The posters I modeled for were placed in train stations all around Japan. However, the biggest posters are in Osaka and 
                Kyobashi station.
